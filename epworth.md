### Epworth Score Analysis on Postoperative Patients

One of the problems that patients with dentofacial deformities experience is reduced quality of sleep due to snoring and/or sleep apnea, especially in patients with
class II skeletal relationship/retrognathia. However, in patients with class III skeletal malocclusion can also experience difficulty breathing due to restricted
upper airway space from maxillary hypoplasia. One way to evaluate how well they breathe is by evaluating their sleep quality. Epworth Sleepiness Scale assesses 
how sleepy one is during the day, which can indicate their quality of sleep overnight. The question to ask is does orthognathic surgery have a significant impact
on how patients sleep at night?

The data analysis shows that there is no significant change in the Epworth Scores from preoperative to postoperative (either POM 6 or POM 12). Since the Epworth score
is assessing overall sleepiness, there are too many variables that contribute to reduced quality of sleep. It would be best to find another way to measure how well
the patients breathe after surgery rather than seeing how sleepy they are during to day.
