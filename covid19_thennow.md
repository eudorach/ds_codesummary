### COVID-19 Then and Now
From when COVID-19 first was identified till now, there has been quite a drastic change. How the world responded to the pandemic was analyzed from the year 2020 till 2021. 

COVID-19 was first discovered in 2019. From then until now, there has been various changes over time that occured, including invention of the COVID-19 vaccines. Many countries have reacted differently to the deadly pandemic and how these countries responded was analyzed.

The average of new cases was computed and sorted to display the lowest 10 countries. These countries were separated into a new dataset and plotted against time.

Looking at these 10 countries with the lowest average of new cases, how the total cases and new cases relate to other factors was analyzed. There are many variables that could affect the number of COVID-19 cases, for example, vaccinations and hand washing stations.

The correlation table shows that there are some significant correlation seen with new cases and some of the variables. There are weak positive correlations with new cases and median age, GDP per capita, and handwashing facilities. With increase in these factors, there are also increase in the number of new cases observed. There are weak negative correlation between new cases and new vaccinations and extreme poverty quotient. With increase in these variables, there are decrease in the number of new cases. These two factors most likely contribute to improving slowdown of the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
