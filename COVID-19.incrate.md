### COVID-19 Case Increase Rate
COVID-19 pandemic started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the globe. Many research and studies were conducted to help better slow
down and hopefully, cease the spread. The dataset was given by Tech Academy and the data was analysed using Python. 

To best analyze the changes that happened over time, the 'date' column of the dataset was separated into 'year', 'month', and 'day' columns.

How vaccination rate affected the number of total cases was analyzed first.

<br> The number of vaccinations as well as total cases increased over time. 

The next criteria examined was how smoking affects the total number of cases.

<br>
The correlation coefficients for these columns were also computed, which showed that there are no strong correlation between
smoking and the number of total COVID-19 cases

Age was another factor that was analyzed.
