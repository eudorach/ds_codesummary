### COVID-19 New Cases Statistics
COVID-19 pandemic started in Wuhan, China in 2019. It quickly spread across the globe. Statistical analysis comparing the countries and the average of new cases that occured in them was performed. The dataset was given by Tech Academy and the data was analysed using Python. 

Initially how the average of new cases varied within continents was performed.

South America had the highest average new case rate followed by North America.

How vaccination rate affected the number of total cases was analyzed first.

<br> The number of vaccinations as well as total cases increased over time. 

The next criteria examined was how smoking affects the total number of cases.

The correlation coefficients for these columns were also computed, which showed that there are no strong correlation between
smoking and the number of total COVID-19 cases
