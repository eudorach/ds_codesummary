# ðŸ¦· Longitudinal Analysis of Oral Health-Related Quality of Life Using OHIP-14

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project analyzes changes in oral healthâ€“related quality of life (OHRQoL) following orthognathic (jaw) surgery, using the OHIP-14 survey instrument. Data were collected at three key timepoints: **pre-op**, **1 week post-op**, and **1 month post-op**. 

The goal was to evaluate whether surgery leads to statistically and clinically meaningful improvements across multiple domains, using patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in a real-world longitudinal setting.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Assess trends in OHIP-14 scores over time following surgery
- Identify domains with statistically significant change
- Determine when the most rapid improvement in OHRQoL occurs
- Support the clinical understanding of recovery trajectories

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Statistical testing (paired t-tests, slope calculations)
- Visualizations of patient recovery trajectories

## ðŸ“Š Methods

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Cleaned and reshaped OHIP-14 data for three postoperative timepoints
   - Verified scoring system for the OHIP-14 instrument
   - Converted long-format survey data into a format suitable for plotting and comparison

2. **Analysis & Visualization**
   - Computed summary statistics by domain and timepoint
   - Performed paired t-tests between baseline and follow-up scores
   - Calculated slopes of score change to assess rate of recovery
   - Visualized trends in both total OHIP scores and domain-specific changes

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Findings

- Significant reductions in total OHIP-14 scores were observed following surgery
- The **steepest slope** of improvement occurred between **baseline and month 3**, suggesting rapid recovery in early postoperative phase
- Continued improvement occurred through 1 year post-op, but at a slower rate
- Psychological and functional
